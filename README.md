This project focuses on conducting data importation through CSV files and performing comprehensive data exploration,
addressing null values, and employing specific cleaning methods tailored to distinct columns.
Additionally, it involves identifying and removing outliers to enhance data quality.
Feature engineering plays a crucial role, incorporating feature scaling, feature selection, and wrapper methods.
Five distinct models have been developed utilizing different algorithms, with cross-validation employed to determine the best-performing algorithm based on accuracy.
To facilitate data analysis, SQLAlchemy has been leveraged to create an engine, and SQL queries are executed in Jupyter, uncovering relevant insights and problem areas within the dataset.
